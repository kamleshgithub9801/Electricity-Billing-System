Electricity Billing System

This java project is a contemporary take on the
classic electricity billing system where a person
gathers data from our electricity meter.
The primary objective of this project is to
automate the entire process to make it seamless,
convenient, and effective. The software can
compute the bill amount on the basis of units of
electricity consumed in a month.
 Electricity Billing System is considered one of the
best java project ideas for beginners. The app
should have the below-mentioned features:

1.Accurately calculate the bill amount.
2. Instantaneous sharing of data between local
electricity offices and users.
3. Extremely safe to negate the chances of
tampering
